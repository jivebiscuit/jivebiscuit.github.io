Since ramp control is not frequently staffed, it may be unfamiliar to many VATSIM pilots. To assist them, the Houston ARTCC website offers a pilot briefing section walking them through how ramp control operates.</p> <p>However, differences in VATSIM pilots' scenery, such as markings, gate positions, and the availability of ramp-specific charts, as well as limitations in directing pushbacks precisely, can impact the efficiency of ramp operations compared to real life. Ramp control must be practical when issuing pushback instructions and intervene if pilots fail to comply.</p> <p>Additionally, ramp control cannot see which gates are occupied by other aircraft, and many simulator pilots are content to occupy any available gate. It is assumed that the pilot will wish to park at terminals and/or gates that their airline or virtual airline affiliation indicate unless indicated otherwise by the pilot. While pilots may be asked their preferred terminal or gate, the main focus of ground and ramp control is to direct them to their designated terminal. Although ramp control may try to accommodate specific gate requests, it is not mandatory. If a pilot insists on waiting for their assigned gate, they should be reminded that the current occupant may remain there indefinitely, as gate utilization on VATSIM is typically first-come, first-served basis.</p>"},{"location":"sop/iah-sop/#2-3-2-ramp-control-tools","title":"2-3-2.

Simultaneous Approach Procedures","text":"<ol> <li>When more than one arrival runway is in use, the final controller working either Runway 11 or 29 shall be responsible for the approach sequence.</li> <li>In IMC conditions or when local control cannot provide visual separation between arrivals, standard IFR separation must be maintained throughout the entire approach and potential missed approach.</li> <li> <p>In VMC conditions, converging aircraft must be sequenced/staggered in such a manner that allows for runway separation to exist in accordance with 7110.65 3-10-4. The following examples are meant to help explain runway separation standards, not be hard-and-fast rules:</p> Example 1 <p>A runway 11 arrival cannot cross the landing threshold until a runway 20 arrival is clear of the runway, passed the projected intersection, or will hold short of the projected intersection. Since no LAHSO exists for the projected intersection, and most arrivals exit runway 20 at taxiway E, the earliest point at which separation will exist is likely after the arrival passes the projected 11/20 intersection. This point is around 1NM down runway 20, but the arrival will be slowing down on the runway simultaneously. Therefore if a runway 20 arrival is on a 7 mile final, the runway 11 arrival should be around a 9 mile final with similar speeds.</p> Example 2 <p>A runway 2 arrival cannot cross the landing threshold until a runway 11 arrival is clear of the runway, passed the projected intersection, or has completed the landing roll and will hold short of the projected intersection. The earliest point at which separation will exist is likely after the runway 11 arrival completes its landing roll. Since most aircraft complete the landing roll around 1NM down the runway, a runway 2 arrival should be staggered around 1NM behind a runway 11 arrival.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"sop/msy-sop/#appendices","title":"Appendices","text":""},{"location":"sop/msy-sop/#a-1-tower-airspace","title":"A-1 Tower Airspace","text":""},{"location":"sop/msy-sop/#a-2-non-turbojet-headings","title":"A-2 Non-Turbojet Headings","text":""},{"location":"sop/msy-sop/#a-3-tracon-airspace-maps","title":"A-3 TRACON Airspace Maps","text":"SE and SW Flow NE Flow NW Flow Final Radar MSY 11 Final Radar MSY 20 Final Radar MSY 2 Final Radar NEW 18R Final Radar NEW 36LR"},{"location":"sop/msy-sop/#a-4-assc-departure-gates","title":"A-4 ASSC Departure Gates","text":""},{"location":"sop/sat-sop/","title":"SAT Tower &amp; TRACON SOP","text":"Disclaimer <p>This document is provided for Houston ARTCC controllers to use when providing virtual ATC services on the VATSIM network.
