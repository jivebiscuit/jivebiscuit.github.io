## 3. Event Operations
### 3-1. Event Classification
VATSIM events may vary widely in scope, type, application, and nature that controller staffing is requested or required. Events have been designated into a scale system that better aligns the events department with what staffing resources may be required to fulfill the needs of each event.
#### 3-1-1. Large-Scale Events
ZHU home Friday Night Operations (FNO), Cross the Pond, solo ARTCC featured weekend events, ZFW ARTCC D10 TRACON major events.

**Required Staffing:** Applicable to the intensity of a complex or high volume aircraft traffic level event. Facility position splits and full coverage of most or all controller positions are often necessary for these kinds of events

#### 3-1-2. Standard-Scale Events
Events that do not require full top-down staffing of all of a facility’s positions, but at least staffing of each primary controlling position to ensure workload is divided effectively during an event.

**Required Staffing:** Houston Center and most of the event’s primary facility positions (Delivery, Ground, Local, etc.)

#### 3-1-3. Small-Scale Events
Weeknight events at minor airports or airspaces. It may also include support staffing for smaller-scale neighboring ARTCC events.

**Required Staffing:** Houston Center and potentially some additional positions to alleviate Houston Center workload.

### 3-2. Event Sign Ups
Any controller, home or visiting with a rating of “S1” or higher, is welcome to sign up for events. Controllers shall only sign up for positions they are certified or endorsed to work. The events team will always strive to accommodate any controller’s request for a position; however, this isn’t guaranteed.

Positions initially assigned shall be considered tentative, and are subject to change at any time as the needs and event staffing levels are dynamic. Controllers who refuse to work an assigned position will not be tolerated and will be noted on their ZHU ARTCC controller file. Continued history of demonstrating this attitude may result in the controller receiving an events ban at the discretion of the Events Coordinator.

### 3-3. Controller Position Assignments
Selection for a position is based on a few factors, such as whether the controller is a home or visiting controller, the controller’s event score, as well as the controller’s track record with ZHU as a whole. Those who are assigned a position are given their position based on the operational needs of the event. Should a controller have any questions about their position or the event, the questions should be directed to the events team.

Students who hold a SOLO certification will be permitted to work their SOLO-certified position during small-scale events only as defined by Chapter 3-1 of this policy. Students may not work SOLO-certified positions for standard-scale and large-scale events unless approved by the ZHU ARTCC Training Administrator.

### 3-4. Attendance And Participation
#### 3-4-1. Basic Expectations
A controller’s willingness to sign up for an event implies that the controller’s availability starts from the event briefing until the end time of the event or assigned event controlling time slot unless otherwise coordinated.

#### 3-4-2. Event Briefings
Briefings are essential to any event’s success. They serve as an opportunity for the events team to present what is to be expected throughout the event. Potential briefing items include, but are not limited to, weather, expected airport configurations, controller position assignments, and event Traffic Management Initiatives.

All relevant information regarding briefing times and position shifts will be posted to the ZHU discord one (1) day before the event. Briefings shall typically take place 15-30 minutes before each large event unless otherwise indicated by the events team. Small or standard-scale events typically will not have a pre-event briefing. The events team will announce if there will be a briefing and when to show up at least one (1) day before the event.

In the interest of keeping event staffing effective and reliably covered, failure to attend or coordinate the absence or tardiness of a ZHU event briefing with the event’s CIC will likely also result in the reassignment of a controller’s event position. Controllers who demonstrate a pattern of tardy or no-show appearances to ZHU event briefings may result in not be assigned an event position until the event briefing time

#### 3-4-3. Briefing Changes
Changes regarding event briefings shall be communicated to all controllers signed up to work the event at least 12 hours before the event’s start time and date. All event-related communications will be conducted via Discord and consideration should be placed on utilizing email if changes are urgent or done so in a last-second manner.

#### 3-4-4. Event Cleanup
Event cleanup is the process in which controllers remain online past the end of the published event finish time to work remaining air traffic. Any controllers who wish to participate in “clean up” duties will be awarded extra credit towards their event score as defined in Section 9 of this chapter as a reward. To receive extra credit for clean-up, the controller must have been assigned to at least one shift during the event.

### 3-5. Event Debriefs
Debriefs may be held at the discretion of the events department and ARTCC senior leadership. Debriefs typically begin immediately following or in the minutes leading up to the conclusion of the event. Debriefs are meant to be facilitated because controllers are prompted to speak freely and reflect on what went well and what could have been improved. Additionally, further identification or policies, procedures, agreements, or facility engineering bugs should be identified and submitted to the correct departments for further review. This feedback is detrimental to improving future ZHU ARTCC operations and events performance.

A formal event debrief may be published at the discretion of the EC. Event debriefs shall be published via the debrief thread on the ZHU ARTCC Discord server. In the interest of recency, formal debriefs shall be published no later than 7 days after the event’s conclusion. Small-scale and support events may also have a formal debrief thread and written summary published post-event at the EC’s discretion.

### 3-6. Event Scoring
#### 3-6-1. Event Scoring System
The event scoring system is designed to award controllers who have demonstrated the highest dependability for ARTCC events. Higher-scoring controllers will often be assigned to positions that are most challenging or busy. A controller’s running event score factors in a variety of criteria to assign event scores to controllers. A controller’s running event scoring criteria include:

- General event and event briefing attendance
- Fulfilling controller requested and assigned event staffing shifts
- Optional bonus credit for participation in event clean-up duties

After ARTCC event completion, a controller’s event score is calculated and averaged with the controller’s running event score from all of their past ARTCC events. Controllers who do not attend event briefings, no-show events without proper prior coordination, or who do not fulfill their requested and assigned event staffing shift (unless otherwise coordinated), will have their event score negatively impacted.

Controllers with a low running events score are encouraged to continue to participate in ARTCC events adhering to the ZHU Events Policy controller requirements to further improve their events score. Controllers can also improve their score with bonus points by participating in clean-up staffing after an event only if they had worked an assigned position during the event. This is done in an effort to encourage controllers with low running event scores to still participate in ARTCC events while going above and beyond after the event.

ZHU staff and events team staff reserve the right to issue temporary exemptions or score adjustments due to behavioral issues, procedural compliance, and controller performance throughout an event to a controller’s event score or position assignment when necessary.

#### 3-6-2. Event Scoring Scale & Restrictions
| Event Score | Event Position Assignment Restriction | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| >90% | First priority for controller preferred sign up positions | Controllers may be subject to assignment to other event positions depending on staffing availability. |
| 89-76% | Second priority for controller preferred event positions | |
| 75-60% | A controller may not be assigned standard-scale and larger event positions at the events team discretion. | Automated email will be sent to the controller as a warning regarding their new potential limitation of event assignments. |
| <59% | A controller will not be considered for standard-scale and larger events and higher unless operationally needed. | Second automated email will be sent to the controller as a warning regarding their new restriction category. |

## 4. ARTCC Support Staffing Policy
Organizations and entities requesting ATC coverage from ZHU ARTCC are required to submit ATC their staffing request via the Request Support forum on the ZHU ARTCC website events section. All support requests shall be submitted no less than 14 days before the requested staffing date and time. This request must include the name of the organization, the name of the event, fields as applicable, an event banner if applicable, an estimated number of pilots who will participate in the event, and potential routes or routes to be flown.

A request for ATC coverage per this policy is not a guarantee of coverage. Based on the ZHU ARTCC controller and event demands, the request for event support may be denied in the judgment of the ZHU ARTCC events coordinator. Denial of event support staffing does not necessarily mean ATC coverage will be denied outright, but rather that ZHU ARTCC will not openly advertise the event on its website.

The Houston ARTCC supporting events policy was created to ensure that Houston’s neighbors can be able to receive ample support staffing from our controllers. Houston has nine neighboring ARTCCs and FIRs that they must support in addition to hosting ZHU ARTCC home events which can quickly result in an over-saturated events calendar with little to no relief resulting in controller and event burnout. ARTCCs requesting support staffing will have solicited supporting event sign-ups only if the neighboring ARTCC event:

1. Takes place within ZHU’s support event service volume.
2. Neighboring ARTCC has not exceeded more than two support event staffing requests in a rolling thirty-day period.

!!! note
    Exceptions may be made at the EC’s discretion for major events such as Cross the Pond, live format events, and other recurrent network flying events.

Due to airspace design and inherent responsibilities shared with Fort Worth ARTCC, a separate event support staffing strategy that exempts Fort Worth ARTCC from the two supporting event staffing request rules and a varied approach is taken towards minimum staffing strategies for various levels and locations of Fort Worth ARTCC events.

**General Staffing Strategies:**

Staffing signups should be appropriate to the expected volume of event traffic.

| Type of Event | Terminal Staffing | Enroute Staffing | TMU Staffing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
ZHU Large Events | Top/Down at event airport(s) | Minimum of one | Preferred |
| ZHU Small & Standard Events | Top/Down at event airport(s) | Minimum of one | Not Required |
| Overflight Events | Not required | Minimum of one^1^ | Not Required |
| Crossfire Events | Top/Down at event airport(s) | Minimum of one | As required |
| Neighbor Events | Not required | Minimum of one | As required |
| D10 Major Events | I90 Top/Down preferred^2^ | Minimum of one | Preferred |
| D10 Minor Events | Not Required | Minimum of one | As required |
| ZFW Other Events | Not Required | Minimum of one | As required |

*^1^ Additional enroute staffing to alleviate workload in the low airspace stratum and terminal environments may be required depending on the expected volume and routings of event traffic.*

*^2^ Other focus airport staffing signups may be utilized if desired at the EC’s discretion.*
