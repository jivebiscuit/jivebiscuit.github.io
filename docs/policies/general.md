- George Bush Intercontinental (IAH) ATCT (All positions)

#### 2-1-2. Tier 2
Per GCAP regulatory guidance via VATSIM, AMAS, and VATUSA policies, Tier Two designations are reserved for airspaces and airports that require knowledge beyond the minimum competencies outlined for controllers to earn each of their controller ratings. Controllers must complete a purely theoretical-based training and examination process
to earn Tier Two endorsements.

**ZHU ARTCC Approved Tier Two Facilities**

## 3. ARTCC Operations
### 3-1. Activity Requirements
ZHU ARTCC places its community members' needs and commitments first including outside of the hobby. Activity requirements are created in the interest of ensuring that controllers remain current and proficient in their controlling skills and abilities. Activity requirements are also used to help ensure a consistent and accurate participation record on the ARTCC roster to understand the ARTCC’s needs and performance better. The activity requirements are not designed to be punitive and are expected to be complied with quarterly.

ZHU ARTCC members who are unable or expect to not be able to meet the activity requirements are encouraged to complete a Leave of Absence application as outlined in Section 4 of this chapter. ZHU ARTCC members who fail to meet the activity requirements may be removed from the facility roster. The ZHU ARTCC ATM shall maintain records of all controllers removed from the roster and their activity leading up to their removal. These records shall be maintained for at least one (1) year.

### 3-2. Staff Activity Requirements
Any person holding a ZHU ARTCC staff position including ATM, DATM, TA, EC, FE, WM, and their assistants including instructors and mentors shall complete at least six (6) hours of controlling on the VATSIM network within each calendar year quarter (January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December). The six (6) required hours quarterly may also consist of a combination of both controlling and providing controller instruction within the ZHU ARTCC training department.

Staff members are also expected to maintain an active presence on the ZHU ARTCC TeamSpeak and Discord. While there is no hourly quota for ARTCC staff to fulfill this requirement, ZHU ARTCC staff are expected to reliably field questions and provide support for their respective departments in their designated channels of communication promptly. Staff who will be temporarily unavailable (vacations, personal obligations, etc.) shall notify the ATM as soon as practical in advance of the absence.

### 3-3. Controller Activity Requirements
#### 3-3-1. General Controlling Activity Requirement
Home and visiting controllers that hold the controller rating of S1, S2, S3, C1, or C3. Any home or visiting controller shall control at a minimum of three (3) hours within each calendar year quarter (January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December).

Home and visiting controllers holding any ZHU ARTCC Tier 1 endorsement must also additionally comply with this section's Tier 1 Currency Requirement in section 3-3-3.

Controllers failing to meet the general controlling activity requirements or not in compliance with section 3-4-2 of this policy regarding controlling activity requirements when returning from Leave of Absence will be removed from the Houston ARTCC roster.

#### 3-3-2. ZHU ARTCC Observers
Any home controller who does not hold an S1 rating shall complete at least three (3) hours of training time with a mentor or instructor of the ZHU Training Department within each calendar year quarter (January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December).

#### 3-3-3. Tier 1 Currency Requirement
In the interest of keeping Tier 1 endorsed controllers proficient and familiar with Tier 1 facility operations, both ZHU ARTCC home and visiting controllers that hold a ZHU ARTCC Tier 1 endorsement must fulfill the following requirements based on controller rating and endorsed airports and airspaces.Controlling time used to satisfy the Tier 1 currency requirement is also eligible to be used towards meeting the ZHU ARTCC general activity requirement of three (3) hours quarterly.

Controlling hours used to meet the Tier 1 Currency Requirement also apply to the ZHU ARTCC General Controlling Activity requirements.

**KIAH Endorsed Controllers**

Controllers who hold a KIAH Tier 1 certification must fulfill a Tier 1 three (3) hour quarterly currency controlling requirement on the highest endorsed position that the controller is certified to work at their individual endorsed facility.

**I90 TRACON Endorsed Controllers**

S3 controllers who are Tier 1 endorsed to work the I90 TRACON must control a minimum of three (3) hours quarterly on any I90 TRACON controller position. KIAH currency requirements are satisfied automatically when the I90 TRACON Tier 1 currency requirement is met.

**Center Certified Controllers**

All ZHU ARTCC center certified controllers must satisfy the quarterly Tier 1 currency requirements by controlling a position of the I90 TRACON for a minimum of three (3) hours quarterly. Controlling time providing top-down coverage of the I90 TRACON is applied toward fulfilling the quarterly Tier 1 currency requirement.

#### 3-3-4. Failure to Meet Tier 1 Currency
Home and visiting controllers with a controller rating of S3 or lower who fail to properly meet their applicable three (3) hour Tier 1 Currency Requirement in a calendar quarter will have their Tier 1 endorsements removed and will be subject to regaining endorsements through the training process again as follows.

**KIAH Tier 1 Endorsed Controllers**

Will lose the highest endorsed position of their KIAH Tier 1 endorsement.

??? example "Example"
    An S2-rated controller who does not complete a minimum of three (3) controlling hours on KIAH Local within a calendar quarter will have their KIAH Local certification revoked and will revert to KIAH Ground certification status.

**I90 TRACON Endorsed Controllers**

Will lose their I90 TRACON endorsement only and revert to only KIAH Tier 1 certification status.

**C1+ Rated TRACON Endorsed Controllers**

Will lose their I90 endorsement and revert to KIAH Tier 1 certification status and may only work Houston Center when the I90 TRACON is staffed by another controller until regaining their Tier One I90 TRACON endorsement.

#### 3-3-5. Currency Requirement Exemption
Specialty-designated controllers such as VATUSA ACE Team members utilized for event periods only are not subject to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 endorsement requirements and any type of currency requirements due to their qualifications, selection process, and demonstrated ad-hoc ability to work new airports and airspaces. If any specialty designated controllers are on the ZHU ARTCC roster, they will be held to the same currency requirements that all home and visiting controllers are subject to.

### 3-4. Leaves of Absence
#### 3-4-1. Leave of Absence Process
ZHU places its members' needs and commitments first, including outside of the VATSIM hobby, focusing on leading a healthy and balanced lifestyle. If any home or visiting controller feels they will or may not be able to satisfy both their quarterly controlling requirements and, if applicable, their Tier One currency requirements, they should submit a Leave of Absence as soon as practical.

Leaves of absence at ZHU ARTCC are nonpunitive and are done on a no-questions-asked basis. Controllers on leave will retain their spot on the roster and are exempt from currency or activity requirements during their leave. Controllers are encouraged to set a conservative return to active status date when submitting their Leave of Absence. In the interest of preventing abuse of ZHU’s leave of absence program, Controllers may not control ZHU or any other facility when on leave status with the ZHU ARTCC.

Controllers may only request leave of absence status for a minimum of one month (30 days) when applying for leave of absence status. A maximum of one year leave of absence may be requested. Controllers requiring more than a year shall contact the ZHU ARTCC ATM for relief of this requirement. Leave of absence submissions must be via the ZHU ARTCC website Leave of Absence request page.

#### 3-4-2. Return from Leave Of Absence Process
Controllers are assumed to have returned from leave status based on the return date selected on their Leave of Absence request. When returning from leave, controllers are liable for meeting the currency requirements in a prorated nature as outlined in paragraph 3-4-3 of this section.

Controllers on leave status are welcome to return before their originally listed return date. Early return from a leave of absence status can be accomplished from the "Leave of Absence" section on the controller's dashboard on the ZHU ARTCC website.

#### 3-4-3. Returning Controller Currency Requirements
Controllers who go on leave of absence will be exempt from any hour requirements set forth by the ZHU General Policy ONLY within the month in which their LOA status was submitted to begin. Controllers are additionally subject to still fulfilling currency hours toward their Tier 1 Currency controlling requirements before starting leave past the first month of the quarter. Failure to do so could potentially result in loss of Tier 1 endorsements.

| Months Remaining in Quarter Before LOA Start Date | Prorated Return General Controlling Hours Requirement |Prorated Leave Start Tier 1 Currency Requirement |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2 | 2 Hours | 2 hours at KIAH |
| 1 | 1 Hour | 1 hour at KIAH |

Controllers who return from leave of absence are required to satisfy the prorated number of hours which are remaining in the quarter including the month that they have returned within. Controllers are also subject to still fulfilling currency hours toward their Tier 1 Currency controlling requirements.

| Months Remaining in Quarter After LOA Return Date | Prorated Return General Controlling Hours Requirement |Prorated Return Tier 1 Currency Requirement |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3 | 3 Hours | Must meet normal Tier 1 currency requirements. |
| 2 | 2 Hours | 2 hours at KIAH |
| 1 | 1 Hour | 1 hour at KIAH |

#### 3-4-4. Leave of Absence Tier 1 Endorsement Policy
In the interest of keeping controllers competent and current on Tier One facility procedures and demands:

**S3 and higher controllers** who take more than six (6) months of continuous leave will have their Tier One I90 TRACON endorsement removed. Controllers returning from leave may be fast-tracked at the discretion of the ZHU Training Department TA who previously had higher levels of I90 TRACON experience before taking the six (6) months or longer of leave on a case-by-case basis.

**S1 and S2 controllers** who take more than three (3) months of continuous leave will have all Tier One endorsements removed and must undergo abbreviated endorsement re-training with the ZHU Training Department to be re-endorsed to staff all ZHU ARTCC Tier One positions. Controllers who previously had relatively significant levels of Tier One airport and/or airspace experience before taking three (3) months or longer of leave may be fast-tracked for Tier 1 recertification at the discretion of the ZHU Training Department Training Administrator (TA) on a case-by-case basis.

### 3-5. Transfers & Reinstatements
According to GCAP guidelines, transferring or returning controllers will automatically be subject to any local rules but will retain their current controller rating, whilst learning the ZHU ARTCC environment.

#### 3-5-1. Initial Qualifications
Before being accepted onto the ZHU ARTCC roster, if it has been determined at the Senior Staff’s discretion that an applying reinstated controller or transferring controller has been gone for an abnormally long extended period and may have degraded levels of ATC proficiency and skills during their period of leave, they may be subject to an initial knowledge screening before being added to the ARTCC roster. Reinstated and transferring controllers upon acceptance per GCAP regulations may initially control unrestricted airports and airspaces up to their certified controller rating upon being added to the ZHU ARTCC roster

#### 3-5-2. Transfer Controller Tier 1 & Tier 2 Qualifications
Reinstated and transferring controllers, even if previously endorsed on any VATUSA ARTCC Tier 1 or Tier 2 facility, must complete any ZHU ARTCC Tier 1 or Tier 2 required training programs to earn the required endorsements to staff those positions within the ZHU ARTCC.

#### 3-5-3. Reinstated Controller Tier 1 & Tier 2 Qualifications
Reinstated ZHU home and visiting controllers may be fast-tracked in re-earning their Tier 1 and Tier 2 endorsements at the discretion of the ZHU Training Department TA. Candidates for this re-endorsement fast-track approach must satisfy the following points:

- Have previously had relatively significant levels of experience within the tiered position they are being endorsed at the discretion of the ZHU ARTCC TA.
- Must have been less than one (1) calendar year since the controller left or was removed from the ZHU ARTCC. 

Candidates who fail to meet all of the above fast-track endorsement requirements must undergo complete Tier 1 and Tier 2 endorsement training.

## 4. ZHU ARTCC Platforms
### 4-1. General
#### 4-1-1. Website
The ZHU website shall be considered a primary communications mechanism. All official communications or distributions sent by other means shall be made available by the website if practical. The current ZHU ARTCC ATM shall be the custodian of the website and ZHU ARTCC official domain. Controllers are expected to periodically visit, review, and acknowledge any pending policy or operational changes when prompted as a formal means of acknowledging compliance with updates in policies, procedures, agreements, and references on the ZHU ARTCC website.
#### 4-1-2. Email
Email shall be considered a primary communication mechanism between ZHU ARTCC controllers and ZHU ARTCC staff members. ZHU ARTCC staff members shall make available their VATSIM registered email forwarding address (Example: `zhu-atm@vatusa.net`) for official communications. ZHU may issue individual email addresses to members with a demonstrated need.

ZHU ARTCC staff shall retain official emails for at least twelve (12) calendar months. ZHU ARTCC staff members shall keep their VATUSA registered email address on the VATUSA website current. Failure to do so may result in delays in communications. The ZHU ARTCC shall not be responsible for missed communications as a result of a staff member’s failure to maintain their account. ARTCC-wide distribution announcements may be made via, but are not restricted to, VATUSA email broadcast services.

### 4-2. Controlling
#### 4-2-1. ZHU Policies, Procedures, Agreements, & References
Officially controlled ZHU ARTCC policies, procedures, agreements, and reference documents are hosted on the resources section of the ZHU ARTCC website. These documents when accessed via the ZHU ARTCC website are considered to be governing and current upon access. Controllers are strongly encouraged to not use personally created cheat sheets or references as these will often become outdated over time or may contain errors. ZHU documents and references are updated and vetted before distribution by multiple members of the ZHU ARTCC staff before publication.

#### 4-2-2. ZHU ARTCC Information Display System (IDS)
*This section reserved for future IDS/ERIDS system development.*

#### 4-2-3. Online Controller Contactability
Controllers must be connected and present in the ZHU TeamSpeak while controlling any position in the ZHU ARTCC regardless if any other controllers are online. This is done in an effort to improve contactability and visibility of current controllers and ease the process of any controllers wishing to additionally sign on below, around, or above any currently online controllers.

Controllers may momentarily disconnect from the ZHU TeamSpeak if needed to coordinate in other Discord/TeamSpeak servers with other facilities or positions, but should use any CRC functions available to attempt the coordination first (facility shoutlines, VSCS override and call functionalities, etc.).

!!! note
    A TeamSpeak Connection guide is available on the ZHU website for assistance with installing and configuring TeamSpeak on your computer.

### 4-3. Social Media
#### 4-3-1. ZHU ARTCC Social Media/Discord/Teamspeak Policy
The members of ZHU ARTCC are expected to act in the highest regard. This includes candor, professional integrity, etc. While we like to have fun and enjoy ourselves, it's important to remember that we need to remain respectful of all individuals. Members must be respectful of others, regardless of any background, including sexual orientation, gender identification, etc.

a. All VATSIM CoC, CoR, User Agreement, and VATUSA policies shall be enforced. All violations shall be reported to the ZHU ARTCC ATM.

8. Attempting to circumvent a disciplinary timeout/ban via a separate account.

#### 4-3-2. Social Media Platform Channel Usage
Controlling or flying channels are designed for those currently controlling or flying on the VATSIM network only. The use of these channels comes with the expectation of:

a. The ability to concentrate on controlling or flying, regardless of traffic volume.

b. The ability to coordinate with other controllers or fellow pilots without delay, audio obstruction, or the need to move channels.

c. The absence of distractions is not directly related to network operations.

#### 4-3-3. ZHU ARTCC DISCORD
The ZHU ARTCC utilizes an official ZHU ARTCC Discord server for community text communications, meetings, and other various ARTCC and community related activities. Access to ZHU’s Discord server is a privilege. Members are assigned their complete name (as registered with VATSIM) as their nickname on the Discord server and must link their VATUSA account with their Discord profile per Welcome Channel instructions. This is done to ensure proper synchronization of server roles and display names can be done automatically. Controllers wishing to use another name than their VATSIM registered name must request from the ZHU ARTCC staff to be given specific Discord server permissions to utilize their desired nickname.

Controllers should monitor the Discord chats whenever practical as ARTCC information is quickly disseminated via Discord. Discord voice communication will be utilized during training sessions and for general correspondence of ARTCC matters. Discord screen-sharing may also be utilized during training sessions.

#### 4-3-4. ZHU ARTCC Streaming Policy
ZHU ARTCC roster members are allowed and encouraged to stream or record their VATSIM controlling sessions on streaming platforms. However, according to the ZHU ARTCC social media policy, streaming controllers are expected to comply with the ZHU social media policy behavior standards when streaming and to be good stewards and representatives of the ARTCC during stream sessions and on streaming platforms in general.

In the interest of protecting other ZHU ARTCC member's identities and information. Controllers should not share personal identifying information about other controllers or their given names on streams or recordings. When streaming or recording sessions, ZHU ARTCC controllers MUST:

1. Remain in the designated streaming channel(s) on the ZHU ARTCC Discord unless actively coordinating.

This policy is also written in alignment with strict international identity protection laws. Failure to adhere to the streaming policy will result in a warning, disciplinary action, and potential removal for repeat offenders from the ARTCC with a referral note placed in the controller’s VATUSA record.
