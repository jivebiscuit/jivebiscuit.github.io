    *An asterisk indicates that all Tier 1 endorsements must be completed to progress.*

#### 2-1-2. GCAP Compliance
All ZHU ARTCC training flow lessons are compliant with VATSIM GCAP and VATUSA DP002 policy. The ZHU ARTCC training flow is designed to be completed without gaining any extra endorsements up to the S3 rating, at the controller’s discretion, as required in GCAP 8.5(e).

#### 2-1-3. Repeating Lessons
Lessons contained in the ZHU Training Syllabus shall be repeated if necessary until the prescribed completion standards are met. Instructors or Mentors have discretion to repeat a lesson that was already completed, if they deem necessary.

#### 2-1-4. Prerequisite Requirements
Requirements before beginning certain training sessions can be waived at the discretion of the ZHU Training Administrator, such as controlling hour requirements. Such requests for waivers should be submitted via email to the Training Administrator.

#### 2-1-5. Tier 1 Endorsements
Tier 1 Endorsements are issued for IAH ATCT and I90 TRACON, in accordance with GCAP 7.5. These endorsements are optional to a controller up to the S3 rating.

#### 2-1-6. Tier 2 Endorsements
Tier 2 Endorsements are issued for HOU ATCT and all ZHU Enroute positions IAW GCAP 7.4. Those pursuing the HOU T2 endorsement must pass the respective ZHU Academy courses to gain the endorsement.

#### 2-1-7. Solo Endorsements
A. A solo endorsement is an opportunity for a student to practice a position before an S2, S3, or C1 Rating Exam is attempted. The solo endorsement shall not be issued due to lack of available practical training. Solo endorsements are issued by an Instructor or the Training Administrator.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. A Subdivision shall issue solo endorsements for a continuous period with a duration of up to 45 days. The maximum duration of all solo endorsements can be extended to 90 days, at the permission of the Deputy Director Training Services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The ZHU Events Policy outlines restrictions on controllers with solo certifications operating during certain events.

#### 2-1-8. Violations
Violations of this policy may suspend a student from pursuing training temporarily, at the discretion of the Training Administrator. Students may lose the ability to request and partake in training. Violations made by training staff will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

### 2-2. Training Sessions
#### 2-2-1. Requesting Training
All training requests must be made on the ZHU website, except as provided for by 2-2-2 of this policy. Students must only submit time blocks during which they are completely available. Instructors and Mentors will then schedule a session from that block of time. Students are permitted to submit up to 7 training requests at one time. Once a training staff member schedules a session, the student will be notified via email. All students are subject to 2-2-4 of this policy.

#### 2-2-2. Impromptu Training
Instructors and Mentors are permitted to announce their immediate training availability in the #impromptu-training channel in the ZHU Discord. Students shall not post their own availability in this channel, and instead use the guidelines in 2-2-1 of this document. Training staff must only use this channel when there is no student availability to choose from on the website.

#### 2-2-3. Improper Training Requests
Controllers may not solicit training from an Instructor or Mentor by any means. This includes, but is not limited to, asking in any text format or in the ZHU Discord or TeamSpeak. Training staff operate voluntarily, and students should respect that commitment.

#### 2-2-4. No-Shows
Students must make all efforts to attend training sessions that they are scheduled for. A student is considered a no-show if they fail to attend the session within 10 minutes of session start. A trainer is considered a no-show if they fail to attend the session within 10 minutes of session start. All student no-shows will be documented on the ZHU website. If a trainer is to no-show, the student may email the Training Administrator in writing, at `zhu-ta@vatusa.net`, with a complaint, no later than 24 hours after the occurrence.

#### 2-2-5. Cancelling Sessions
Students and Training Staff are encouraged to cancel sessions at least 12 hours in advance of session start. In the case of extenuating circumstances, this can be waived at the discretion of the trainer. Students or training staff seen continuously breaking this policy will receive one warning, and any further violations will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Training Staff are authorized to cancel an ongoing training session if a student is not prepared for said training session.

#### 2-2-6. Training Location & Observation
All training at ZHU must be conducted in one of the classroom channels within the ZHU Discord. The Instructor or Mentor has full discretion to allow students, controllers, staff, or a Mentor In Training to observe in these channels, only when the trainee permits. Observation is not permitted during a rating examination.

#### 2-2-7. Recurrent Training
Controllers who are already certified for a position can receive recurrent training. This can be done if the student wants to improve proficiency or wants a refresh. Evaluation for performance in recurrent training shouldn’t impact the student’s training record, and the training staff member should only suggest more recurring training if needed. Training staff must not remove certifications. It is at the discretion of the training staff member as to which sweatbox file to run or if the session is held on the network.

#### 2-2-8. Transferring/Visiting Controllers
Transferring and Visiting Controllers should familiarize themselves with ZHU policies and procedures before considering controlling a position. Transferring and visiting controllers are automatically given all unrestricted certifications through their current rating. Controllers are required to undergo IAH ATCT and I90 TRACON Tier 1 courses, and the online ZHU Academy HOU ATCT courses to gain those endorsements. Transferring or visiting controllers who are C1 rated must undergo Houston Center Tier 2 training before controlling a Houston Center position.

#### 2-2-9. Live Network Monitoring 
Live network monitoring should only be held if the pertinent ZHU lesson authorizes the trainer the option to do so. Exceptions to this rule can be given by the TA. Training staff are authorized to control a position above the student and simultaneously monitor the student, if traffic levels permit. Trainers may only be on a position above the student, and not below. Students may only be monitored during an event posted on the ZHU website with the approval of the Training Administrator and the Events Coordinator. If neither are present, consult the Air Traffic Manager.

#### 2-2-10. Rating Examinations
Rating (Previously “OTS”) Examinations test students on either a live (not including OBS to S1) or simulated basis on practical applications for the purpose of rating promotions. Rating examinations are required to gain VATSIM ratings S1 through C1. S3 and above rated Mentors are permitted to conduct the S1 rating examination. Only Instructors (I1, I3) are permitted to conduct S2 through C1 rating examinations. Instructors and Mentors must follow VATUSA guidelines when conducting rating examinations.
