### 2-3 Ground Control
#### 2-3-1 Duties
- a. Ground Control must notify Local Control when an aircraft has been taxied to a runway other than the active runway(s).
- b. Ground Control must notify Local Control of aircraft taxied to an intersection for takeoff. This may be accomplished non-verbally by marking the flight strip.
- c. When possible, sequence traffic to local control by alternating SIDs/departure courses.
- d. When “CFR” applies to the aircraft’s destination airport, coordinate with TMU for a departure time when the aircraft calls for taxi.
- e. Coordinate with LC to the extent necessary to ensure that arrival aircraft are able to exit the runway without conflicting with aircraft taxiing on adjacent taxiways. Whenever necessary, adjust the ground traffic flow to allow arrival aircraft to exit the runway unimpeded.
- f. GC must coordinate any request that crosses or uses any portion of an active/inactive runway with LC on the recorded line. Prior to coordinating, GC should reference any of LC's traffic to determine if the operation is feasible.
### 2-4 Local Control
#### 2-4-1 Duties
- a. All turbojets shall be instructed to “Fly Runway Heading.” All non-turbojets shall be assigned headings in accordance with Appendix 2.
- b. Tower airspace SFC-1,500ft is depicted in Appendix 1. When departing runway 20 or 2, a departure climb corridor is in effect for the corresponding runway.
- c. Local control shall have automatic releases on all departures, so long as the aircraft is departing on the ATIS advertised runway, and on a standard heading in accordance with Appendix 2.
- d. Local shall radar identify all departures, initiate a STARS track, and execute an automated radar handoff to the appropriate controller prior to communications transfer. It is the TRACON’s responsibility to inform the aircraft that they are “Radar Contact.”
- e. Local Control must use the STARS “Quick Look” function in order to view arrival information for all aircraft.
- f. Line up and wait procedures are authorized in accordance with 7110.65 3-9-3.
#### 2-4-2 Missed Approach Instructions
Issue control instructions to establish approved separation (i.e. visual, vertical, passing or diverging, or vectors), with other known traffic, as soon as feasible. Coordinate with the
corresponding radar controller and issue runway heading/2,000.
#### 2-4-3 Converging Runway Operations
During VFR weather conditions, LC must visually separate all aircraft making simultaneous approaches to multiple runways. Any time that LC cannot accomplish the duties of this paragraph, LC must notify the appropriate approach controller(s).
- a. For simultaneous approaches to converging runways, apply procedures outlined in 7110.65 3-10-4:
  - i. The first arrival must have completed one of the following before the second arrival crosses the landing threshold:
    - 1. Cleared the runway
    - 2. Completed landing roll and will hold short of the projected intersection
    - 3. Passed the projected intersection
- b. For a departure taking off after a converging arrival, apply procedures outlined in 7110.65 3-9-9:
  - i. The arrival must have completed one of the following before the departure begins its takeoff roll:
    - 1. Cleared the runway
    - 2. Completed landing roll and will hold short of the projected intersection
    - 3. Passed the projected intersection
- c. For an arrival landing after a converging departure, apply the procedures outlined in 7110.65 3-10-4:
  - i. The departure must be passed the projected intersection path or is airborne and turning to avert any conflict before the arrival crosses the landing threshold.
- d. Specific procedures for departing runway 29 and landing runway 2:
  - i. A heavy jet/B757 must not be authorized to LUAW on Runway 29 when an arriving aircraft is anticipated to land behind the heavy jet on Runway 2.
  - ii. A turbojet may depart Runway 29 from the full length provided the departure will be 6,000 feet down the runway prior to the arriving aircraft crossing the landing threshold of Runway 2.
## 3 TRACON Procedures
### 3-1 General Operations
#### 3-1-1 Radar Position Duties
- a. Must provide radar service to aircraft operating in their respective airspace as depicted in Appendix 3.
- b. Planned missed approach instructions shall be verbally coordinated with local control.
- c. Arrival aircraft shall have their scratchpad marked in accordance with the General Control SOP Chapter 2, section 2.
- d. All radar positions must avoid the tower departure area (Appendix 1) unless approved by Local Control.
#### 3-1-2 Automated Point Our Procedures
To reduce verbal coordination, the STARS point out function may be used between all intra-facility positions within MSY ATCT/TRACON.
- a. APO procedures are authorized when the following conditions are met:
  - i. The initiating and receiving controllers must ensure the associated full data block information is correct, usable and easily understood.
  - ii. It shall be assumed that the aircraft is on course or is being vectored toward the information displayed in the scratchpad.
  - iii. Additional coordination may sometimes be required to complete the point out and grant approval. Any necessary traffic, restrictions, or additional coordination must be accomplished verbally.
  - iv. By approving the Automated point out, the receiving controller indicates the associated data block contains sufficient information to ensure aircraft separation is maintained, and authorizes the initiating controller to enter the receiving controller’s area of jurisdiction. If the information contained in the FDB is insufficient to approve the operation, verbal coordination must be accomplished prior to approving the automated point out.
#### 3-1-3 Transfer of Control
Shall be accomplished in accordance with the ZHU General Control SOP section 1-4-1.
#### 3-1-4 Practice Instrument Approaches for VFR Aircraft
To the maximum extent possible, New Orleans Approach Control will provide radar services and IFR separation from all IFR traffic and other VFR aircraft practicing instrument approach procedures at MSY, NEW, HUM, NBG, and HDC during published operational hours of their respective control towers.
#### 3-1-5 Simultaneous Approach Procedures
- a. When more than one arrival runway is in use, the final controller working either Runway 11 or 29 shall be responsible for the approach sequence.
- b. In IMC conditions or when local control cannot provide visual separation between arrivals, standard IFR separation must be maintained throughout the entire approach and potential missed approach.
- c. In VMC conditions, converging aircraft must be sequenced/staggered in such a manner that allows for runway separation to exist in accordance with 7110.65 3-10-4. The following examples are meant to help explain runway separation standards, not be
hard-and-fast rules:
  - i. EXAMPLE 1 - A runway 11 arrival cannot cross the landing threshold until a runway 20 arrival is clear of the runway, passed the projected intersection, or will hold short of the projected intersection. Since no LAHSO exists for the projected intersection, and most arrivals exit runway 20 at taxiway E, the earliest point at which separation will exist is likely after the arrival passes the projected 11/20 intersection. This point is around 1NM down runway 20, but the arrival will be slowing down on the runway simultaneously. Therefore if a runway 20 arrival is on a 7 mile final, the runway 11 arrival should be around a 9 mile final with similar speeds.
  - ii. EXAMPLE 2 - A runway 2 arrival cannot cross the landing threshold until a runway 11 arrival is clear of the runway, passed the projected intersection, or has completed the landing roll and will hold short of the projected intersection. The earliest point at which separation will exist is likely after the runway 11 arrival completes its landing roll. Since most aircraft complete the landing roll around 1NM down the runway, a runway 2 arrival should be staggered around 1NM behind a runway 11 arrival.
