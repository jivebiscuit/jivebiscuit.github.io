        - 1. NW-Bound: AEX / MCB / SQS / NTCHZ

        - 3. E-Bound: CEW
        - 4. SE-Bound: BLVNS / REDFN
        - 5. S-Bound: LEV
        - 6. W-Bound: Valid I90 STAR Transition / PEKON / LFT
    - iii. For all other aircraft, clear “As Filed.”
- b. Issue the following initial altitudes to IFR aircraft:
    - i. Turbojets maintain 4,000.
    - ii. Non-Turbojets maintain 2,000.
#### 2-2-3 VFR Aircraft
- a. The following information must be obtained and entered into vNAS for all VFR departures:
    - i. Aircraft Type
    - ii. Destination/On Course Heading
    - iii. Requested Altitude
- b. All VFR departures shall be given:
    - i. Class Bravo Clearance
    - ii. The following altitudes:
        - 1. Turbojets maintain VFR at 4,000.
       - 2. Non-Turbojets maintain VFR at 2,000.
    - iii. An appropriate departure frequency
    - iv. A squawk code
- c. VFR aircraft requesting pattern work shall only be given bravo clearance and squawk code.
### 2-3 Ground Control
#### 2-3-1 Duties
- a. Ground Control must notify Local Control when an aircraft has been taxied to a runway other than the active runway(s).
- b. Ground Control must notify Local Control of aircraft taxied to an intersection for takeoff. This may be accomplished non-verbally by marking the flight strip.
- c. When possible, sequence traffic to local control by alternating SIDs/departure courses.
- d. When “CFR” applies to the aircraft’s destination airport, coordinate with TMU for a departure time when the aircraft calls for taxi.
- e. Coordinate with LC to the extent necessary to ensure that arrival aircraft are able to exit the runway without conflicting with aircraft taxiing on adjacent taxiways. Whenever necessary, adjust the ground traffic flow to allow arrival aircraft to exit the runway unimpeded.
- f. GC must coordinate any request that crosses or uses any portion of an active/inactive runway with LC on the recorded line. Prior to coordinating, GC should reference any of LC's traffic to determine if the operation is feasible.
### 2-4 Local Control
#### 2-4-1 Duties
- a. All turbojets shall be instructed to “Fly Runway Heading.” All non-turbojets shall be assigned headings in accordance with Appendix 2.
- b. Tower airspace SFC-1,500ft is depicted in Appendix 1. When departing runway 20 or 2, a departure climb corridor is in effect for the corresponding runway.
- c. Local control shall have automatic releases on all departures, so long as the aircraft is departing on the ATIS advertised runway, and on a standard heading in accordance with Appendix 2.
- d. Local shall radar identify all departures, initiate a STARS track, and execute an automated radar handoff to the appropriate controller prior to communications transfer. It is the TRACON’s responsibility to inform the aircraft that they are “Radar Contact.”
- e. Local Control must use the STARS “Quick Look” function in order to view arrival information for all aircraft.
- f. Line up and wait procedures are authorized in accordance with 7110.65 3-9-3.
#### 2-4-2 Missed Approach Instructions
Issue control instructions to establish approved separation (i.e. visual, vertical, passing or diverging, or vectors), with other known traffic, as soon as feasible. Coordinate with the
corresponding radar controller and issue runway heading/2,000.
#### 2-4-3 Converging Runway Operations
During VFR weather conditions, LC must visually separate all aircraft making simultaneous approaches to multiple runways. Any time that LC cannot accomplish the duties of this paragraph, LC must notify the appropriate approach controller(s).
- a. For simultaneous approaches to converging runways, apply procedures outlined in 7110.65 3-10-4:
    - i. The first arrival must have completed one of the following before the second arrival crosses the landing threshold:
        - 1. Cleared the runway
        - 2. Completed landing roll and will hold short of the projected intersection
        - 3. Passed the projected intersection
- b. For a departure taking off after a converging arrival, apply procedures outlined in 7110.65 3-9-9:
    - i. The arrival must have completed one of the following before the departure begins its takeoff roll:
         - 1. Cleared the runway
        - 2. Completed landing roll and will hold short of the projected intersection
        - 3. Passed the projected intersection
- c. For an arrival landing after a converging departure, apply the procedures outlined in 7110.65 3-10-4:
    - i. The departure must be passed the projected intersection path or is airborne and turning to avert any conflict before the arrival crosses the landing threshold.
- d. Specific procedures for departing runway 29 and landing runway 2:
    - i. A heavy jet/B757 must not be authorized to LUAW on Runway 29 when an arriving aircraft is anticipated to land behind the heavy jet on Runway 2.
    - ii. A turbojet may depart Runway 29 from the full length provided the departure will be 6,000 feet down the runway prior to the arriving aircraft crossing the landing threshold of Runway 2.
