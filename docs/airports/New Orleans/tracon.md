## 3 TRACON Procedures
### 3-1 General Operations
#### 3-1-1 Radar Position Duties
- a. Must provide radar service to aircraft operating in their respective airspace as depicted in Appendix 3.
- b. Planned missed approach instructions shall be verbally coordinated with local control.
- c. Arrival aircraft shall have their scratchpad marked in accordance with the General Control SOP Chapter 2, section 2.
- d. All radar positions must avoid the tower departure area (Appendix 1) unless approved by Local Control.
#### 3-1-2 Automated Point Out Procedures
To reduce verbal coordination, the STARS point out function may be used between all intra-facility positions within MSY ATCT/TRACON.
- a. APO procedures are authorized when the following conditions are met:
    - i. The initiating and receiving controllers must ensure the associated full data block information is correct, usable and easily understood.
    - ii. It shall be assumed that the aircraft is on course or is being vectored toward the information displayed in the scratchpad.
    - iii. Additional coordination may sometimes be required to complete the point out and grant approval. Any necessary traffic, restrictions, or additional coordination must be accomplished verbally.
    - iv. By approving the Automated point out, the receiving controller indicates the associated data block contains sufficient information to ensure aircraft separation is maintained, and authorizes the initiating controller to enter the receiving controllerâ€™s area of jurisdiction. If the information contained in the FDB is insufficient to approve the operation, verbal coordination must be accomplished prior to approving the automated point out.
#### 3-1-3 Transfer of Control
Shall be accomplished in accordance with the ZHU General Control SOP section 1-4-1.
#### 3-1-4 Practice Instrument Approaches for VFR Aircraft
To the maximum extent possible, New Orleans Approach Control will provide radar services and IFR separation from all IFR traffic and other VFR aircraft practicing instrument approach procedures at MSY, NEW, HUM, NBG, and HDC during published operational hours of their respective control towers.
#### 3-1-5 Simultaneous Approach Procedures
- a. When more than one arrival runway is in use, the final controller working either Runway 11 or 29 shall be responsible for the approach sequence.
- b. In IMC conditions or when local control cannot provide visual separation between arrivals, standard IFR separation must be maintained throughout the entire approach and potential missed approach.
- c. In VMC conditions, converging aircraft must be sequenced/staggered in such a manner that allows for runway separation to exist in accordance with 7110.65 3-10-4. The following examples are meant to help explain runway separation standards, not be
hard-and-fast rules:
    - i. EXAMPLE 1 - A runway 11 arrival cannot cross the landing threshold until a runway 20 arrival is clear of the runway, passed the projected intersection, or will hold short of the projected intersection. Since no LAHSO exists for the projected intersection, and most arrivals exit runway 20 at taxiway E, the earliest point at which separation will exist is likely after the arrival passes the projected 11/20 intersection. This point is around 1NM down runway 20, but the arrival will be slowing down on the runway simultaneously. Therefore if a runway 20 arrival is on a 7 mile final, the runway 11 arrival should be around a 9 mile final with similar speeds.
    - ii. EXAMPLE 2 - A runway 2 arrival cannot cross the landing threshold until a runway 11 arrival is clear of the runway, passed the projected intersection, or has completed the landing roll and will hold short of the projected intersection. The earliest point at which separation will exist is likely after the runway 11 arrival completes its landing roll. Since most aircraft complete the landing roll around 1NM down the runway, a runway 2 arrival should be staggered around 1NM behind a runway 11 arrival.
