1. All radar positions must avoid the tower departure area [Appendix 2](#a-2-airspace-maps) unless approved by Local Control.
1. Assign an initial IFR altitude of 3,000 for all non-towered satellite airport departures.

#### 3-1-2. Automated Point Out Procedures
To reduce verbal coordination, the STARS point out function may be used between all intra-facility positions within AUS ATCT/TRACON.

1. APO procedures are authorized when the following conditions are met:
    1. The initiating and receiving controllers must ensure the associated full data block information is correct, usable and easily understood.
    1. It shall be assumed that the aircraft is on course or is being vectored toward the information displayed in the scratchpad.
    1. Additional coordination may sometimes be required to complete the point out and grant approval. Any necessary traffic, restrictions, or additional coordination must be accomplished verbally.
    1. By approving the Automated point out, the receiving controller indicates the associated data block contains sufficient information to ensure aircraft separation is maintained, and authorizes the initiating controller to enter the receiving controller’s area of jurisdiction. If the information contained in the FDB is insufficient to approve the operation, verbal coordination must be accomplished prior to approving the automated point out.

#### 3-1-3. Transfer Of Control
Shall be accomplished in accordance with the [ZHU General Control SOP 1-4-1](../sop/general-control-sop.md#1-4-1-transfer-of-control).

#### 3-1-4. Airspace Delegation
1. Airspace maps can be found in [Appendix 2](#a-2-airspace-maps). If an IFR altitude is delegated to a position of operation, the VFR altitude 500 feet below the IFR altitude is also delegated to the same position of operation unless otherwise designated.
1. Radar West assumes the airspace of Austin Finals and Satellite Radar when closed.
1. Radar East assumes the airspace of Radar South when closed.
1. When Radar South is open, they may assume the airspace of Satellite Radar depending on traffic conditions.

#### 3-1-8. Non-RNAV STAR Altitudes

    1. Radar East 5,000
    1. Radar West 6,000

#### 3-1-9. Practice Instrument Approaches For VFR Aircraft
Approach Control feeder positions (RW, RE and RS) must issue climbout instructions to aircraft executing a missed approach or rerun at satellite airports.

1. IFR separation in accordance with [FAA JO 7110.65](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/) must be provided to VFR aircraft conducting practice instrument approaches at:
    1. KAUS
    1. KEDC
    1. KGTU
    1. KHYI
1. IFR separation will not be provided to aircraft operating under VFR that practice instrument approaches to other satellite airports within the Austin terminal area.

#### 3-1-10. Simultaneous Approach Procedures

1. Simultaneous independent approaches shall be conducted in accordance with [7110.65 5-9-7](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap5_section_9.html). The following final monitor duties shall be performed by the Austin Finals controller:
    1. Instruct the aircraft to return to the correct final approach course when aircraft are observed to overshoot the turn-on or to continue on a track which will penetrate the NTZ.
    
        ??? example "Phraseology"
            YOU HAVE CROSSED THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE. TURN (left/right) IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN TO THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE, or TURN (left/right) AND RETURN TO THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE.

    1. Instruct aircraft on the adjacent final approach course to alter course to avoid the deviating aircraft when an aircraft is observed penetrating or in your judgment will penetrate the NTZ. 
    
        ??? example "Phraseology"
            TRAFFIC ALERT, (call sign), TURN (right/left) IMMEDIATELY HEADING (degrees), CLIMB AND MAINTAIN (altitude).

#### 3-1-10. Prearranged Coordination Procedures (P-ACP).
The controller using prearranged coordination to enter another controller’s airspace is responsible for maintaining approved separation between aircraft under their control and all aircraft in the airspace they will transit by observing the data blocks (position symbol, mode C readout, heavy aircraft/B757 information) of all radar positions with which they are utilizing prearranged coordination procedures to determine the appropriate separation to be applied.
