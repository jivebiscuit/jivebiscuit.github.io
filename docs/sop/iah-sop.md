### 2-3. Ramp Procedures
#### 2-3-1. Ramp Control General
The primary goal of ramp control is to maintain the orderly flow of aircraft entering and exiting within its designated area, while ensuring that ground control's areas remain operational. Since ramp control is not frequently staffed, it may be unfamiliar to many VATSIM pilots. To assist them, the Houston ARTCC website offers a pilot briefing section walking them through how ramp control operates.

However, differences in VATSIM pilots' scenery, such as markings, gate positions, and the availability of ramp-specific charts, as well as limitations in directing pushbacks precisely, can impact the efficiency of ramp operations compared to real life. Ramp control must be practical when issuing pushback instructions and intervene if pilots fail to comply.

Additionally, ramp control cannot see which gates are occupied by other aircraft, and many simulator pilots are content to occupy any available gate. It is assumed that the pilot will wish to park at terminals and/or gates that their airline or virtual airline affiliation indicate unless indicated otherwise by the pilot. While pilots may be asked their preferred terminal or gate, the main focus of ground and ramp control is to direct them to their designated terminal. Although ramp control may try to accommodate specific gate requests, it is not mandatory. If a pilot insists on waiting for their assigned gate, they should be reminded that the current occupant may remain there indefinitely, as gate utilization on VATSIM is typically first-come, first-served basis.

#### 2-3-2. Ramp Control Tools
Ramp control shall rely primarily on tower cab view and the IAH ASDE-X feed to direct ramp traffic. United, Delta and all regional carrier aircraft parking at the terminal ramp will be given an ASDE-X primary scratchpad entry indicating the requested gate. Approved scratchpad abbreviations can be found in paragraph [2-5-1](#2-5-1-general-duties).

#### 2-3-3. Ramp Splits
1. The primary combined ramp position will be North Ramp control.
1. In a two ramp controller position split, North and West Ramp control will be utilized.
    1. North Ramp control is responsible for all North terminal ramp areas of control
    1. West Ramp control is responsible for all South terminal ramp areas of control.
1. In a three ramp controller position split, North, East, and West Ramp control will be utilized.
    1. North Ramp control is responsible for all North terminal ramp areas of control
    1. East Ramp control is responsible for all South terminal ramp areas of control East of the taxiway RA/RB bridges.
    1. West Ramp control is responsible for all South terminal ramp areas of control West of the taxiway RA/RB bridges.
    1. For aircraft transitioning between east and west ramps, the ramp controller shall issue a taxi clearance and instruct the aircraft to contact the other ramp controller’s frequency when reaching the RA/RB bridge.
    
        ??? example "Phraseology"
            `“United 1, taxi via R2 RA, contact West ramp at the RA bridge 123.45”`

#### 2-3-6. Procedures
1. Ramp control shall utilize standardized RA/RB bridge taxi flows unless optionally necessary and coordinated between East and West ramp control when staffed.
    1. RA for westbound taxiing aircraft
    1. RB for eastbound taxiing aircraft
1. No pushback clearances shall be given to aircraft when gate hold procedures are effective until terminated by TMU.
1. Ramp control and IAH ground must resolve all conflicts with their own traffic before releasing an aircraft to the other facility’s control.
1. Ramp control will advise aircraft at gates A29 and A30 to contact ground metering for pushback when all conflicts are resolved. IAH ground may use the ramp area south of these gates for pushback.

    ??? example
        `“Go around, (runway), (location of aircraft), (call sign, if able).”`

1. For aircraft inside the final approach fix, but not over the runway:

    ??? example
        `“(call sign), go around, (track the localizer or track the final approach course), maintain 2,000.”`

1. For aircraft over the runway:

    ??? example
        `“(call sign), go around, (fly runway heading or assign a compass heading for wind correction), maintain 1,700.”`

1. Issue safety/traffic alerts in a timely manner to all affected aircraft.
1. After completion of coordination with the appropriate Local Controller, issue additional control instructions to ensure missed approach/go around aircraft will exit the IAH airspace via an appropriate departure gate, at or climbing to 3,000.
1. Handoff the missed approach/go around aircraft to the appropriate Satellite controller.
    1. If the aircraft is still being tracked by Final, coordinate so that the appropriate satellite controller has track control of the aircraft.
1. When necessary, coordinate via the landline any pertinent information related to the missed approach/go around aircraft with the TRACON.

#### 2-6-7. Arrival/Departure Separation
1. Unless visual separation can be applied, ensure that departure aircraft have begun takeoff roll at or prior to the following:
    1. May continue to depart 15L/15R with all commercial jet and cargo jet aircraft when visual separation cannot be maintained with runway 27 arrivals provided that applicable radar separation to arrival aircraft landing runway 27 is maintained.
    1. Ensure that corporate/general aviation jets, props, and turbo-prop departure aircraft have begun takeoff roll on 15L/15R at or prior to an arrival reaching 2NM from the runway 27 threshold.
    1. Departing Runway 15L/15R – Runway 9 arrival is 5 NM from Runway 9. Once the Runway 9 arrival has passed Runway 15L/15R (ASDE-X, ASR-9, or visually observed), Runway 15L/15R departures may be released reference other Runway 9 arrivals. All provisions of FAA JO 7110.65, applicable paragraphs, Non-Intersecting Converging Runway Operations/Intersecting Runway Separation must apply.

        ??? note
            In real life, red runway status hold lights will appear on runways 15L/R when a runway 9 arrival passes a 2.8nm final. When these lights are activated, pilots are expected to abort their takeoff. Due to simulator limitations, these runway status lights do not exist, but controllers should strive to have aircraft rolling on 15L/R before the next runway 9 arrival hits a 3.3nm final in visual conditions. A memory aid has been placed at this point on the STARS TDW scope.

1. Dependent Operations – Regardless of weather conditions, Local Control must use the following restrictions when departing the runway pairings below.:
    1. Departing 33R and landing 27:
        1. The Arrival Departure Window (ADW) map(s) must be depicted on the local control STARS map.
        1. Departure aircraft must be rolling prior to the landing aircraft entering the ADW.
        1. Departure aircraft may takeoff after an arrival aircraft has landed and/or exited the ADW.
    1. Departing 33L/R and landing 26L:
        1. The Arrival Departure Window (ADW) map(s) must be depicted on the local control STARS map.
        1. Departure aircraft must be rolling prior to landing aircraft entering the ADW.
        1. Departure aircraft may takeoff after an arrival aircraft has landed and/or exited the ADW.
        1. All north-bound departure aircraft must be assigned runway heading. Once the departing aircraft flies through the extended centerline of Runway 26L, the aircraft will be assigned a heading to exit IAH airspace via the north departure gate.

            ??? note
                The West most (larger) ADW box is for 33L. The full (both combined) ADW box is for 33R.

1. Northwest Flow Clarification:
    1. When ceilings are greater than 2,500 feet and visibility allows for visual observation of Runways 27/26L/26R arrival traffic at the FAF, the following runway pairings may be used independently:
        1. Departing 33L/R and landing 26R
        1. Departing 33L and landing 27
    1. When ceilings reduce to 2,500 feet or visibility prevents visual observation of Runways 27/26L/26R arrival traffic at the FAF, a straight west flow configuration must be utilized.

#### 2-6-8. I90 Airspace Delegated To IAH
IAH is authorized use of I90 Airspace depicted in Area A, [Appendix 2](#a-2-i90-airspace-delegated-to-iah-and-hou-atct). If I90 desires to use this airspace, coordination with IAH must be required. If I90 has traffic below 1,500 feet MSL within the lateral confines of airspace depicted in Area A, [Appendix 2](#a-2-i90-airspace-delegated-to-iah-and-hou-atct) they must force the target onto Local West (4T) display.

#### 2-6-9. Automated Point Out Procedures
1. When using an automated point out, the initiating controller must ensure that scratchpad information is correct.
1. The receiving controller must, either via automation or verbal means:
    1. Approve the point out
    1. Unable to point out
    1. Accept control of the aircraft

#### 2-6-10. Opposite Direction Operations (ODO)

**Definition:** IFR/VFR Operations conducted to the same or parallel runway where an aircraft is operating in a reciprocal direction of another aircraft arriving, departing, or conducting an approach.

1. Same Runway Procedures:
    1. IAH Local Control and I90 Controlling Sectors are responsible for initiating coordination required to accomplish an opposite direction arrival or departure.
    1. IAH Local Control is responsible for applying the cutoff point between arriving and departing aircraft.
    1. The I90 Controlling Sector is responsible to apply the cutoff point between successive ODO arrivals.
    1. All coordination concerning the ODO must be done via a recorded line and state “Opposite Direction.” Initial coordination must include call sign, type, and arrival or departure runway.
    1. Do not allow opposite direction same runway operations with opposing traffic inside the cutoff point unless an emergency exists.
    1. Traffic advisories must be issued to both aircraft

        ??? example
            - `"OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC (distance) MILE FINAL, (type aircraft)."`
            - `"OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC DEPARTING RUNWAY (number), (type aircraft)."`
            - `"OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC (position), (type aircraft)."`

    1. Once an ODO has been approved, any further operations from that runway must be verbally coordinated until the ODO is completed.
    1. The cutoff points (CP) are defined as 10 flying miles from the runway threshold.
    1. Arrival/Arrival: I90 must ensure the first arrival has crossed the runway threshold prior to the second aircraft reaching the cutoff point.
    1. Arrival/Departure: IAH Tower must ensure a departing aircraft is airborne and issued a turn to avoid conflict prior to opposing traffic reaching the cutoff point. I90 must ensure the arrival aircraft does not cross the CP prior to the departing aircraft becoming airborne.
    1. Visual separation is not authorized for Same Runway ODO.
    1. If the conditions in Paragraphs j and k are not met, action must be taken to ensure control instructions are issued to protect the integrity of the cut off points.

1. Parallel Runway Procedures:
    1. Arrivals to parallel runways:
        1. Simultaneous ODO Arrivals may be conducted to Parallel Runways, provided an aircraft executing a go-around or missed approach is issued a turn away from any opposing traffic when inside of the CP to the runway.
            
            ??? note
                Landing Runways 8R/27, 8L/26L, or 8L/27 are not considered an ODO operation unless an aircraft executes a missed approach or go-around.

        1. Traffic advisories are not mandatory unless a missed approach or go-around occurs.
    
    1. Departure and Arrival to Parallel Runways:
        1. Opposite Direction Departures from parallel runways may be conducted, provided the departure is issued a turn away from any opposing traffic when inside of the CP.
    1. Visual separation may be applied after the turn away from the conflicting traffic is issued.
    1. North West Flow: When operating in a North West flow (arriving Runways 26L/26R, departing Runways 33L/33R), depart Runway 9 only when:
        1. Ceiling is at or above 3,000 feet.
        1. Runway 26L arrival traffic is in sight by JEPNI.
        1. Runway 9 departures must be issued a turn away from opposing traffic inside the cutoff point to Runways 26L and observed in a turn away from finals prior to communications transfer.
        1. Traffic must be issued to arrivals and departures of the ODO.
                
            ??? example
                `"Opposite direction traffic landing runway (number), (type aircraft)."`
                
                `"Opposite direction traffic departing runway (number), (type aircraft)."`
