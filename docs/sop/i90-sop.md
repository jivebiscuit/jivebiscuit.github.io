#### 2-1-4. Runway Utilization
1. KIAH runway configuration shall be set by IAH local, utilizing the flows outlined in vZHU IAH SOP 2-1-1.
2. When performing an East/West Flow runway change at KIAH, utilize the following checklist.
    1. IAH local shall initiate the flow change and verbally inform all I90 controllers.
    2. I90 shall identify to IAH the last arrival to land on each runway in the old configuration and the first aircraft to land under the new runway configuration.
        1. It is recommended that all aircraft currently on a downwind or on the Final’s side of the TRACON should continue with the old configuration. All other aircraft should be vectored for the new configuration.
        2. If arrivals must land opposite direction, the outboard runways shall be used. Example – 8L/27.
    3. Ensure Hobby Final is on the “Short Box” if landing KHOU RWY 13R prior to activating both final boxes.
    4. Notify KHOU Tower when a runway change has occurred at KIAH.
    5. Notify Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZHU) of the new runway configuration.
3. When changing runways at KHOU:
    1. HOU local shall initiate the flow change and verbally inform all I90 controllers.
    2. I90 shall identify to HOU the last arrival to land in the old configuration and the first aircraft to land under the new runway configuration.
4. When changing runways at KDWH:
    1. DWH local shall initiate the flow change and verbally inform all I90 controllers.
    2. I90 shall identify to DWH the last arrival to land in the old configuration and the first aircraft to land under the new runway configuration.

#### 2-1-5. Reduced Longitudinal Separation
Reduced longitudinal separation (2.5 NM) between arrivals may be applied for all East/West runways at KIAH for aircraft established on the Final Approach Course (FAC) within ten (10) NM for the landing runway.

#### 2-1-6. KIAH Authorized Approach Pairings
The following RNAV RNP approaches are authorized for simultaneous use:

1. Simultaneous Independent Approaches to Widely-Spaced Parallel Runways without Final Monitors:
    1. RNAV (RNP) Y RWY 26R with all RWY 27 instrument approaches.
    2. RNAV (RNP) Y RWY 9 with all RWY 8L instrument approaches.

    1. RNAV (RNP) Y RWY 26R with all RWY 26L and/or RWY 27 instrument approaches.
    2. RNAV (RNP) Y RWY 9 with all RWY 8R and/or RWY 8L instrument approaches.

#### 2-1-7. Mode C Altitude
Aircraft being handed off in level flight with altitude information displayed (Mode C or Scratchpad) must be considered to be at their assigned altitude.

#### 2-1-8. Approach Breakout Areas
Satellite or Departure airspace, at or below 3,000 feet MSL, within the lateral confines of Final airspace is for KIAH departures, go-arounds, and/or breakouts only. Final controllers, Final Monitor controllers, and KIAH Local Control positions have control to vector breakouts within this airspace for resequencing.

#### 2-1-9. Practice Approaches
A Letter to Airmen (LTA) has been published for the IFR separation for VFR aircraft practicing instrument approaches. See Appendix A.

#### 2-1-10. Optimized Profile Descent (OPD) Operations
Aircraft that are capable of utilizing OPD (Descend Via) procedures but have been altitude restricted must be coordinated with the receiving controller if the altitude is different from the bottom altitude on the procedure. Controllers may utilize the temporary altitude field in the data block as an automated method of coordination.

#### 2-1-11. Off-Route (Vectored) Aircraft
Controllers that vector an aircraft off an OPD (Descend via) STAR must coordinate the heading and altitude with the next controller. The altitude may be omitted if displayed in the data block.

#### 2-1-12. Altitude Restrictions For PRARI Gate Departures
10,000 feet MSL and 12,000 feet MSL must not be assigned to aircraft departing via the PRARI Gate. This restriction separates from the KIDDZ and SNIFY Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs).

#### 2-1-13. Approach Information
The first controller to work an aircraft that will land at an airport inside their Terminal Area (Houston, College, Beaumont) must satisfy the requirements of 7110.65 4-7-10 Approach Information.

#### 2-1-14. Arrival Runway Assignments
1. Unless otherwise stated in this order, aircraft being handed off to Final controllers must be assigned 6,000 feet and no greater than 210 knots.
2. Provide runway assignment information in the primary scratchpad for all IFR arrival aircraft in accordance with vZHU General Control SOP 2-2-1.
3. Utilize the charts below for optimal runway assignment and altitudes related thereto.
4. The East Arrival and West Arrival short-side (Base-side) feeders are responsible for runway balancing. Runway balancing is defined as keeping equal pressure on the available arrival runways. Gulf Arrival and Eagle Lake Arrival must assist East Arrival and West Arrival when balancing needs exist (e.g., vectors for spacing).
5. If short-side feeders assign a runway that is not on a STAR transition, the aircraft must be vectored. (Shown as **bold** in the tables below).

#### 2-1-15. Wharton/Bay City (KARM/KBYY) Shelf Procedures
1. KARM and KBYY arrivals under TRACON control that will next enter the Center Eagle Lake-Low sector, must be assigned 4,000 feet. Upon communication transfer, TRACON releases the ARM/BYY Control Area to ZHU. The Eagle Lake-Low sector must return the ARM/BYY Control Area to TRACON when no longer in use.
2. Automated point outs may be used for coordinating the release of the ARM/BYY Shelf. The STARS Scratchpad must contain “ARM/BYY” identifying these aircraft. Acceptance of the point-out grants approval for the release of the ARM/BYY Shelf to ZHU Eagle Lake Low Sector.

### 2-2. Automated Internal Coordination
#### 2-2-1. Automated Point Out Procedures
To reduce verbal coordination, the STARS point out function may be used between all intra-facility positions within the I90 TRACON.

1. APO procedures are authorized when the following conditions are met:
    1. The initiating and receiving controllers must ensure the associated full data block information is correct, usable and easily understood.
    2. It shall be assumed that the aircraft is on course or is being vectored toward the information displayed in the scratchpad.
    3. Additional coordination may sometimes be required to complete the point out and grant approval. Any necessary traffic, restrictions, or additional coordination must be accomplished verbally.
    4. By approving the Automated point out, the receiving controller indicates the associated data block contains sufficient information to ensure aircraft separation is maintained, and authorizes the initiating controller to enter the receiving controller’s area of jurisdiction. If the information contained in the FDB is insufficient to approve the operation, verbal coordination must be accomplished prior to approving the automated point out.

#### 2-2-2. Prearranged Coordination Procedures
Positions permitted to use P-ACP must be responsible for maintaining separation from all aircraft within the P-ACP area.

1. Controllers who penetrate another controller’s airspace using P-ACP must display data block information of that controller’s aircraft that must contain, at a minimum, the position symbol and altitude information.
2. Arrival controllers must coordinate verbally, or by use of automation, with the appropriate Departure controller(s) for all aircraft when their route does not follow a published STAR, PAR or other defined route.
3. The Hobby Final controller must coordinate verbally, or by use of automation, with the appropriate Departure Controller(s) prior to altering any aircraft’s route that does not follow the published STAR, PAR, or other defined route.
4. P-ACP may be used as follows:
    1. When departure is combined to one position, departure may use P-ACP to climb aircraft through any portion of arrival (Feeder) airspace. When departure is split, P-ACP through feeder airspace is limited to the respective departure controller’s lateral boundaries only.
    2. Hobby Final may use P-ACP to descend aircraft landing KHOU:
        1. Within Lakeside Satellite airspace that underlies the Hobby Final airspace, when KHOU is landing RWY 13R/L.
        2. Within Lakeside airspace when KHOU is landing RWY 4 as depicted in this chapter, Figure 1.

            ![KIAH Final (West) Prearranged Coordination](../assets/i90-sop3.png)
    
    4. Final South may use P-ACP within Departure South/East airspace, in a West Flow, in the area specified in this chapter, Figure 2.
    5. IAH Final(s) may use P-ACP when KIAH is in an East Flow with Lakeside Satellite and Tomball Satellite airspace east of DWH RWY 17R/35L extended centerline.
    6. SanJac Satellite may use P-ACP for turns only within Departure South/East airspace that is within the KIAH departure corridor once the satellite departure aircraft is clear of the KIAH Surface Area airspace (this includes KIAH airspace that is surface to 1,200 feet MSL).
    7. Lakeside Satellite may use P-ACP for turns only within Departure West airspace that is within the KIAH departure corridor, once the satellite departure aircraft is clear of the KIAH Surface Area airspace (this included KIAH airspace that is surface to 1,200 feet MSL).
    8. Tomball Satellite may use P-ACP for turns only within Departure North airspace that is within the KIAH departure corridor, once the satellite departure aircraft is clear of the KIAH Surface Area airspace (this includes KIAH airspace that is surface to 1,200 feet MSL).

### 2-3. Opposite Direction Operations (ODO)
#### 2-3-1. Procedures
**DEFINITION:** IFR/VFR Operations conducted to the same or parallel runway where an aircraft is operating in a reciprocal direction of another aircraft arriving, departing, or conducting an approach.

1. Same Runway Procedures:
    1. IAH Local Control and I90 Controlling Sectors are responsible for initiating coordination required to accomplish an opposite direction arrival or departure.
    2. The I90 Controlling Sector is responsible for applying the cutoff point between successive ODO arrivals.
    3. All coordination concerning the ODO must be done via a recorded line and state “Opposite Direction.” Initial coordination must include call sign, type, and arrival or departure runway.
    4. Do not allow opposite direction same runway operations with opposing traffic inside the cutoff point unless an emergency exists.
    5. Once an ODO has been approved, any further operations from that runway must be verbally coordinated until the ODO is completed.
    6. Arrival/Arrival: I90 must ensure the first arrival has crossed the runway threshold prior to the second aircraft reaching a 10-mile final.
    7. Visual separation is not authorized for Same Runway ODO.
2. Parallel Runway Procedures:
    1. Arrivals to parallel runways:
        1. Simultaneous ODO Arrivals may be conducted to Parallel Runways, provided an aircraft executing a go-around or missed approach is issued a turn away from any opposing traffic when inside of the Cutoff Point to the runway.
        2. Traffic advisories are not mandatory unless a missed approach or go around occurs.

## 3. Position Duties & Responsibilities
### 3-1. Departure North (M)
#### 3-1-1. Duties
Departure North must:

1. Provide radar service to aircraft in airspace depicted in this section.
2. Upon completion of communications transfer from the appropriate Local Control, advise departure aircraft of radar identification and validate Mode C altitude information. Prior to turning departure aircraft, ensure separation exists between his/her aircraft and aircraft under control of the underlying Satellite position.
3. Vector OHIIO STAR North Satellite arrivals clear of the final box at KIAH and handoff to Tomball Satellite.
4. Advise Tomball Satellite of any aircraft, at or below 3,000 feel MSL, other than KIAH departures that will enter the Departure North surface to 5,000 feet MSL airspace.
5. Provide Class B services within the lateral boundaries of Departure North airspace from 500 feet below delegated IFR altitudes to the vertical limits of Class B airspace.
