## 1. Purpose
This agreement between Houston ARTC Center and Houston TRACON defines responsibilities and procedures for the airspace delegated to Houston TRACON and is supplementary to the procedures contained in [FAA JO 7110.65](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/) and other FAA directives.

## 2. Cancellation
This is the initial letter of agreement between Houston ARTCC and Houston TRACON.

## 3. Scope
The procedures and delegated airspace specified herein are applicable to Houston ARTC Center and Houston TRACON. Each party to this Letter of Agreement must ensure facility personnel are familiar with these procedures.

## 4. Procedures
### 4-1 General
1. Deviations from procedures in this agreement may be effected on an individual basis after verbal coordination is accomplished by the controllers involved.
1. Upon acceptance of a point-out, the TRACON/Center controller as appropriate will be responsible for all further point-outs within their facility, provided the aircraft does not exit and re-enter the receiving facility’s airspace.
1. If a radar handoff on a VFR aircraft cannot be accomplished prior to the appropriate Center/TRACON boundary the Center/TRACON controller must terminate radar service and advise the aircraft of the next frequency.
1. TRACON must ensure that aircraft traveling between the Houston, Beaumont, and Lake Charles Terminal Areas remain within airspace delegated to the TRACON.
1. When an "OPD Altitude" is listed, ZHU shall issue a "Descend via" clearance.
1. "Knock it off" altitudes shall only be used when both I90 and ZHU determine that a "Descend via" clearance is impractical.

### 4-2. Houston Terminal Area Arrival Control
1. Center:
    1. Must route arrival aircraft via the appropriate STAR/AAR and assign the altitudes shown in Tables 1–9. Center must ensure aircraft are established on the appropriate STAR/AAR at or prior to the TCP, except as otherwise noted.
    1. For the purposes of arrival control, turboprops capable of 280 knots IAS or greater must be treated as jets, and jets not capable of 280 knots IAS or greater may be treated as turboprops.
    1. Must provide at least ten (10) NM separation behind an A380, or other aircraft designated as Super.
    1. Long-side (Downwind-side) dual arrivals must be treated as one.
    1. Must coordinate those aircraft that are unable to comply with prescribed procedures contained within the LOA with the TRACON receiving controller. The TRACON receiving controller will be responsible for further internal facility coordination
    1. Must clear aircraft requesting high altitude instrument approach procedures into EFD to DROPP or APRIL IAF and assign 17,000 feet, or the next higher altitude available.
    1. When aircraft on the RNAV STARs are unable to comply with the vertical navigation requirements, an altitude within the OPD restriction at the lateral TCP will be coordinated.
